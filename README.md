1. Data exploration (Data distribution inferences, Univariate Data analysis, Two-sample t-test)
2. Data Correlation Analysis
3. Feature Selection (using Logistic regression)

4. Outlier Detection (using principal component graph)

5. Basic Parameter Tuning(CV, complexity parameter)

6. Data modeling

## Basic GLM (With all Features and eliminating a few features based on AIC)

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree

- Na√Øve Bayes
